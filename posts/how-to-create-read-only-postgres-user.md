Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

In the world of databases, access control is paramount. It's not always necessary (or safe) to give every user full access to your database. Sometimes, you just need a user who can read data without the ability to modify it. That's where read-only users come in handy.

So, without further ado, let's dive into the steps:

## Step 1: Connect to Your PostgreSQL Database

First things first, you need to connect to your PostgreSQL database. You can do this using the `psql` command-line interface or a GUI tool like pgAdmin.

## Step 2: Create a New User

Once connected, you can create a new user with the `CREATE USER` command. For example:

```sql
CREATE USER my_readonly_user;
```

## Step 3: Grant Connect Privilege

Next, you need to grant the `CONNECT` privilege to the new user for the database:

```sql
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE my_database TO my_readonly_user;
```

## Step 4: Set User Permissions

Now, it's time to set the user permissions. You want to grant `USAGE` on the schema and `SELECT` on all tables in the schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO my_readonly_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO my_readonly_user;
```

And voila! You've created a read-only user in PostgreSQL.

Remember, creating a read-only user is a great way to provide data access while maintaining control over your database. It's perfect for users who need to view data but should not be able to modify it.

We hope you find this guide helpful. As always, we're here to make your database journey smoother and more efficient. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to let us know.
