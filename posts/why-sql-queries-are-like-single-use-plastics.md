Today, I'm drawing a somewhat unconventional, yet thought-provoking parallel: SQL is like single-use plastics. Yes, you read that right. Let's dive in!

## The Plastic Predicament

We're all familiar with the environmental concerns surrounding single-use plastics. Their convenience is undeniable, yet their longevity is both their strength and their downfall. They serve their purpose momentarily but linger on far longer than their utility justifies.

Similarly, traditional SQL queries, while powerful and essential, often become "single-use" in the hands of many businesses. Teams spend hours, if not days, crafting the perfect query to extract a particular piece of information. But once the question is answered? That custom-crafted query often gets discarded, just like a plastic straw after one sip of a drink.

## The Costs of One-Time-Only Queries

This approach has costs:

1. **Time and Talent Waste**: The cumulative hours spent crafting these one-off queries amount to immense human capital wastage.

2. **Inconsistency**: Without a systematic approach to reuse and document, each "new" query might offer slightly varied results, leading to inconsistent business intelligence.

3. **Barrier to Data Accessibility**: Non-technical folks often feel stranded in a sea of data, unable to craft the queries needed to fish out the insights they need. This leads to having more than 1 person taking up time to answer a data question.

## So what is there to do about it?

1. **Direct Answers**: With AI like ChatDB, you donâ€™t need to meander through SQL. Pose a question, and the AI fetches you a precise answer, saving invaluable time and resources.
2. **Democratized Data Access**: AI levels the playing field. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or a marketer with no SQL knowledge, you can pull out actionable insights without waiting in line or seeking help.
