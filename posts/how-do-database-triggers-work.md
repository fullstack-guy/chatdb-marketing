# A Comprehensive Guide on How Database Triggers Work

Understanding the fundamentals of database management is vital in today's data-driven world. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore one key aspect: **database triggers**.

## What Are Database Triggers?

Database triggers are procedural codes that are automatically executed in response to specific events on a particular table or view in a database. They help maintain the data integrity and implement the business logic.

## When Are Triggers Used?

Triggers are typically used to enforce complex business rules, validate input data, or maintain complex integrity constraints that cannot be achieved only through a constraint or application code.

## Types of Triggers

There are three main types of triggers: `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, and `INSTEAD OF`.

- `BEFORE` triggers are fired before the triggering event.
- `AFTER` triggers are executed after the triggering event.
- `INSTEAD OF` triggers override the triggering event with a custom action.

## Understanding Trigger Events

Triggers can be associated with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` events.

- `INSERT` triggers are activated when a new record is added.
- `UPDATE` triggers are fired when a record is modified.
- `DELETE` triggers are executed when a record is removed.

## Creating a Simple Trigger

Here's an example of how to create a simple `AFTER INSERT` trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_insert
AFTER INSERT ON orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   INSERT INTO audit(order_id, user, action)
   VALUES (NEW.order_id, CURRENT_USER(), 'INSERT');
END;
```

This trigger will add a record to the audit table every time a new order is added to the orders table.

Database triggers are powerful tools for managing data integrity and business logic. By understanding how to use them effectively, you can greatly enhance the functionality of your databases.
